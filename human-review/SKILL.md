# Human Review

Write comments in **zh-tw**.

## Tool
`{baseDir}/scripts/tuicr-review.sh`:
- `start [--repo PATH] [SCOPE]` — open a review and print its slug.
- `comments [--repo PATH]` — print new comments as JSON.
- `add [--repo PATH] <flags> "text"` — post a comment. Flags: `--target-file`, `--line`, `--end-line`, `--side old|new`, `--type issue|suggestion|note|praise`.

Ask once if SCOPE is missing. Use `working`, a revision/range, or `pr <n>`.

## Workflow
1. Read the scoped `git show/diff` and surrounding code.
   Act as the change's author walking a human through the implementation, rather than conducting a separate defect review.
   Done when you can explain the old and new behavior of each meaningful changed block.

2. Group hunks by concern and draft all comments before `start`.
   Split each hunk into logical blocks of one or a few adjacent lines. Explain each block's old behavior -> change -> new behavior, and why; explain intent and effects rather than paraphrasing syntax.
   Give distinct changes within a function separate comments, anchored to the relevant lines.
   Summarize tests, codegen, and pure moves in one line per logical group; still name any behavior or test-expectation changes.
   Ground reasons in the implementation context; label inferred reasons as assumptions.
   Add a likely objection or toy before/after only when it clarifies a trade-off or a confusing change. Redact secrets.
   Done when every changed hunk is covered by block-level explanations or explicitly included in a brief-summary exception above.

3. Run `start`, then `add`:
   - Review-level first: the change's purpose, which concern to read first, and why.
   - Inline: the block-level explanations and brief summaries from step 2. Anchor each to the relevant code.
   - File-level: only context not already covered by the review-level or inline comments.
   - Use `issue` only for problems.

4. Follow-up:
   - `approved` → stop.
   - New comments → address each, fix as needed, then `start` the same scope. `add` only the reply and any new *delta*.
   - Fetch failure → run `comments` manually.

## Gotchas
- Existing open review → ask the human to press `q`, then retry.
- Abnormal exit sends no trigger.
- Amend/rebase creates a new scope identity; start a new session.
